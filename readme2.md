# Spotify UI/X
## General Info
Creating login and modal page using TailwindCSS for Spotify.

## Problem
WE are now diving into learning  Javascript. This new language	gives us to the functionality to provide further actions and responsiveness to our website.  Our goal is to provide low level of security by requiring users to login into our website and provide information as username and passwords to gain access to the platform, Spotify, our music app.


They want us to implement these login actions using  TailwindCSS and javascript:
* login button
  *Create login passwords to get us to the home page of Spotify
* specifie character count
  *ensure proper username with specified character count

## Process and Solution
We first started by creating a login index.html to create barrier to our existent Spotify page
In this individual exercise our team member designed their own login index page.

Issues that I ran into were that my login page was created with CSS more than Tailwindcss so coding the login page into our initial  Spotify index page powered by tailwindcss in the script file  provided no connectivity to format my login page.

I had to create a new css and index file to work appropriately.
Then came the challenge to coding Javascript  to provided functionality and secure measures.


After we make  sure our 2 pages are link correctly.
We will was upload to GitHub and deployed on Vercel.
